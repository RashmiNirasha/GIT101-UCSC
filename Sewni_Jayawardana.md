**HELLO!**

- *I'm Sewni Jayawardana*.
- I'm studying Computer Science at UCSC.
- My temporary index number is 231076.
- My LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/sewni-jayawardana
- I'm still only familiar with the basics of C and Python.
- Today's session was really good. I didn't know much about repositories and the <mark>importance of branching</mark>. Also, I got to know about the <mark>GitHub Student Developer Pack</mark> today.
Thank you! I'm hoping to participate in many more sessions like this in the future.
